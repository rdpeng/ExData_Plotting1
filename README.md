## Generate plots exploratory data analysis course project 1

You find 8 files in the repository: 4 scripts and 4 png files. Each script generates a png file.

The script will automatically load the necessary data [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip] from the web.
Details to the project as well the data CodeBook can be found here [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1]

To run the code follow the steps below:
1. Download the scripts to your goal directory
2. Run each script and enjoy the results

Hints:
*I removed x axis lable in plot 4 for better readabilty and created a standardized y axis labelling.
*My plotted days are in German. If you are running the scripts you'll get the language accoring your settings.
