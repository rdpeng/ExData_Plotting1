### Introduction

This second programming assignment will require you to write an R
function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations.
For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast
operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to
compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g.
in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make
sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it
can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this
Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of
the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside
of an R object.

### Example: Caching the Mean of a Vector

In this example we introduce the `<<-` operator which can be used to
assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the
current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a
special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean.

The first function, `makeVector` creates a special "vector", which is
really a list containing a function to

1.  set the value of the vector
2.  get the value of the vector
3.  set the value of the mean
4.  get the value of the mean

<!-- -->

    makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
            m <- NULL
            set <- function(y) {
                    x <<- y
                    m <<- NULL
            }
            get <- function() x
            setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
            getmean <- function() m
            list(set = set, get = get,
                 setmean = setmean,
                 getmean = getmean)
    }

The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector"
created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
mean has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the mean from the
cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of
the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the `setmean`
function.

    cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
            m <- x$getmean()
            if(!is.null(m)) {
                    message("getting cached data")
                    return(m)
            }
            data <- x$get()
            m <- mean(data, ...)
            x$setmean(m)
            m
    }

### Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that
cache the inverse of a matrix.

Write the following functions:

1.  `makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special "matrix" object
    that can cache its inverse.
2.  `cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special
    "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
    already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
    `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the `solve`
function in R. For example, if `X` is a square invertible matrix, then
`solve(X)` returns its inverse.

For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always
invertible.

In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:

1.  Fork the GitHub repository containing the stub R files at
    [https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2](https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2)
    to create a copy under your own account.
2.  Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer so that you can
    edit the files locally on your own machine.
3.  Edit the R file contained in the git repository and place your
    solution in that file (please do not rename the file).
4.  Commit your completed R file into YOUR git repository and push your
    git branch to the GitHub repository under your account.
5.  Submit to Coursera the URL to your GitHub repository that contains
    the completed R code for the assignment.

### Grading

This assignment will be graded via peer assessment.

## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

## Loading the data





When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First
calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require
in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough
memory (most modern computers should be fine).

* We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and
2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates
rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those
dates.

* You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to
Date/Time classes in R using the `strptime()` and `as.Date()`
functions.

* Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as `?`.


## Making Plots

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to
reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed
using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)


For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
include the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.


The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below. 


### Plot 1
