## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

This introduction was forked from following GitHub repository:

For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
include the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.


These four plots with respective codes that I construct are shown below:


### Plot 1 
and his code [plot1.R](https://github.com/sergioquadros/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot1.R)
